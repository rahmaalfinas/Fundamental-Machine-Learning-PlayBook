In this folders, I have played woth three datasets: 
- Breast Wiconsin Dataset
- Concrete Slump Test
- Abalone Dataset

Each dataset I have applied different Machine Learning Model, starting from Decision tree for Breast Wiconsin Dataset, 
different type of regressor (Linear Regression, Linear Support Vector Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent Regression, Voting Regression) for Concrete Slump Test, 
and other Regression Model such as decision Tree Regression, random Forest regression, and  Bagging Regression for the third dataset.

I have tried hyperparameters tuning to find the best models with spesifics pair of hyperparameters and add some short analysis for the result.
